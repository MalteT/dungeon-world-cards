On a 7\u20139, the GM should offer a real choice with significant consequence. Think about the behaviors of the character and the things you\u2019ve learned about him in play. Death knows and sees all and tailors his bargains accordingly. This is a trade, remember. Offer something that will be a challenge to play out but will lead the game in fun new direction. On a miss, death is inevitable. The most obvious approach is to say \u201cDeath takes you across the threshold, into his bleak kingdom.\u201d and move on. However, sometimes Death comes slowly.
